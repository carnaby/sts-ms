<h3>Recap</h3>

<p>Follow the instructions below to fill out the worksheet and make sure you have a grasp on what's going on with PHP7!</p>

	// Create a variable that holds the title of your favorite movie!
	
	// Now create a variable that holds the INTEGER year that the movie was released!

	// Now create a variable that holds a STRING value of the current year ('2017')!

	// Now create an array and add the title of your favorite movie onto the end of your new array!

	// Now make a copy of your string, but replace all the spaces with underscores using a string method (don't hard-code it)!

	// Push that copy of your favorite movie string onto your array with key 'underscore' (can also be thought about as
	// pushing onto the array at position 'underscore')

	// Now create another string of the first 7 characters of your favorite movie using a string method (don't hard-code it)!

	// Push that 7-character string onto your array with key 'seven'

	// Now take the length of your original movie string and subtract it from the $current_year variable (variable name may differ)
	
	// Push that integer onto your array with key 'yesteryear'

	// Now create a variable that will hold your comparison result (it will be an integer, in case you were curious)

	// In a single line of code, compare the year your movie was released with the item in your array with key 'yesteryear' and store the following
	// into your comparison result variable:
		// -1 if the year your movie was released was less than the number you came up with
		// 0 if the year your movie was released was exactly equal to the number you came up with
		// 1 if the year your movie was released was greater than the number you came up with

	// Now print your array to the screen in between the <pre> tags below:
?>

<pre>
	<?php
		// Print your array here

		// DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
	?>
</pre>
